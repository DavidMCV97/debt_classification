## Idea
The idea is to do an equivalent of a Linnear Regression algorithm but with a logarithmic function

## Implementation
The implementation is in Python and considers 
- Data cleaning and Feature Engineering
- Data validation
- Partial Derivation Implementation
- Gradent Descent Implementation
- Logaritmic Regression Implementation
- Payment Projection
- Quality Evaluation
